# Project1
Authors: Alec Brownlie & Issac Davidson
----------------------------
To run:
----------------------------
```
[./Project1]$ sh run.sh
```
Expected Output for User Mode:
----------------------------
- For Task 1, use numbers that exceed 5 digits may noticeably slow down program. This is due to the number of basic operations made by the consecutive integer checking algorithm.
- Console Output:

```

Expected Output for Scatter Plot Mode:
-----------------------------
- n for Task 1 is random at runtime between the range 60-150.
- k for Task 2 is set at 85. 
- List A and List B are set to size 150 that contain random number of 2s and 3s.
- When scatter plot graphs are generated, windows for each graph may be stacked on top of another.
